# feed-generator
Project to fetch data from a client external resource and a XML file, process and return a valid xml feed for a Sizmek DCO Campaign.

#Description

For this project we needed to create a cron in our server to process two different xml files and return a xml file with a valid data feed for a DCO campaign. We had to analice dates, create slug urls for the movies and clone the movie posters into our server.

This process will execute automatically each 24h.
